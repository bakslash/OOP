There are four major principles of Object-Oriented Programming-
 Encapsulation,Abstraction,Polymorphism and Inheritence


Encapsulation

EncapsulationÂ is one of the main concepts in OOP. It is also called "information hiding". An object has to provide its users only with the essential information for manipulation, without the internal details Encapsulation is the hiding of data implementation by restricting access to accessors and mutators. 

Accessor
An accessor is a method that is used to ask an object about itself. In
OOP, these are usually in the form of properties, which have, under
normal conditions, a get method, which is an accessor method.
However, accessor methods are not restricted to properties and can be
any public method that gives information about the state of the object.

Mutator 
Mutators are public methods that are used to modify the state of an object, while hiding the implementation of exactly how the data gets modified. Mutators are commonly another portion of the
property discussed above, except this time its the set method that lets the caller modify the member data behind the scenes.
